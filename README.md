## Motivation

I'm sure many of us have had this thought "I should invest my money ðŸ¤”" 

One of the biggest things that hold many of us back is knowlege.

* Where do I invest?
* What do I invest in?
* Why should I invest in it?
* Is it safe?

One of the best ways to answer some of these questions is to learn as much as possible about an asset.

CoinView is your one-stop-shop for crytpcurrency information and news.
